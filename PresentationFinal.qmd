# Introduction

This paper asks what role taxation can or might play in reducing high levels of inequality in low- and middle-income countries. Are policy instruments like the personal income tax or value-added tax used in similar ways as in high-income plots countries’ tax characteristics as a function of their development level, for which we use GDP per capita as a proxy(Bachas et al., 2024).

The authors highlight the challenges of progressive taxation in low- and middle-income countries, focusing on statutory incidence, tax evasion, and economic incidence of taxes .

## Objectives

-   To demonstrate accurate reproducability of Figure 1 from the academic paper provided
-   To write a report using Quarto and R Markdown
-   Publish the report as a website through GitHub
-   Showcase challenges and issues face during replication of result.

## Figure 1

\![Figure1(Tax Systems across the Development Path)](papergraph.png)

-   The figure depicts how the total share of GDP collected in taxes evolves from lower-income to higher-income countries.
-   Total Tax Revenue: Increases with economic development, indicating higher tax collection capabilities in wealthier countries.

## Dataset

-   The data for Figure 1 was compiled from various primary micro-datasets, which are detailed in the "Cross-Country Data" sheet of the "Data Sources" document in the replication package.
-   This dataset is created by running the `Master_cross_country.do` file, which harmonizes income and employment variables and merges them with other relevant datasets(Bachas et al., 2024).

## Dataset

-   The dataset includes 132 countries with populations over one million and excludes those where revenue from oil and gas exceeds one-third of GDP. This sample covers 93 percent of the world's population. The data for 2018 were compiled from various sources, including individual countries' government archives, the OECD, and UNU-WIDER/ICTD which were compiled into "Master_crosscty.dta" (Bachas et al., 2024).

## Dataset

Variables used from dataset

-   gdp_pc, ndp_usd = GDP per Capita

-   pct_tax, relyear_incometax = Total Tax Revenue

## Code

-   Install packages, load libraries

-   Set working directory and input dataset

```{r}
#| echo: True
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2|3|5|6|7-8"

if (!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
suppressMessages(pacman::p_unload(all))
pacman::p_load(tidyverse,haven,dplyr)

setwd("C:/HSF/data sciene/final")
data2 <- read_dta("Master_crosscty.dta")
data <- read_csv("globalETR_bfjz.csv")
```

## Code

Mutate data to preferred variables

```{r}
#| echo: True
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2|3"
data <- data %>%
  mutate(GDP_per_capita = ndp_usd / 1000000,
         Total_Tax_Revenue = pct_tax
         )

```

```         
```

## Code

Plot Graph

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| include: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2|3|4-8|9-13"
plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = GDP_per_capita, y = pct_tax)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +  
  labs(
    title = "Total tax revenue (excl. SSC)",
    x = "GDP per capita (constant 2010 US dollars, log scale)",
    y = "Share of GDP"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
```

## Code

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| fig.width: 10
#| fig.height: 5

plot
```

## Using Master_crosscty data package

```{r}
#| eval: true
data2 <- read_dta("Master_crosscty.dta")
data2 <- data2 %>%
  filter(!is.na(gdp_pc) & !is.na(relyear_incometax)) %>%
  mutate(GDP_per_capita = gdp_pc,
         Total_Tax_Revenue = relyear_incometax)
plot2 <- ggplot(data2, aes(x = GDP_per_capita, y = Total_Tax_Revenue)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() + 
  labs(
    title = "Total tax revenue (excl. SSC)",
    x = "GDP per capita (constant 2010 US dollars, log scale)",
    y = "Share of GDP"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )

```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| fig.width: 10
#| fig.height: 5

plot2
```

## Challenges

-   Familiarizing with the dataset, understanding the variables, and their significance.

-   Dealing with missing values in the dataset and filtering.

-   Exact points not being depicted as shown in the result given on the paper.

-   Faced many issues while pushing the presentation to Github.
